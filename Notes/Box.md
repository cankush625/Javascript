# Box in JavaScript

JavaScript supports three kinds of boxes, viz:
- Alert - Gives an alert box
- Confirm - Gives a pop-up with OK and Cancel buttons
- Prompt - Gives a pop-up with the input box

Calling alert box: `alert()` OR `window.alert()`

We don't need to call the alert by `window.` because JavaScript by default considers the function is present in `window`.
